# sclang

## Introduction
sclang is a minimalistic declarative language for state machine description. It is bundled with two tools:
* graph: a statechart diagram generator
* code: a C code generator

The main idea is to have a tool to automatically generate all the boilerplate code related to the state machine logic,
allowing the developer to only focus on the actions of the system.
